1] JSX is javascript syntax which is used in react that helps us to write HTML and javascript together in component.
2] Babbel is transpiler which helps to convert jsx code to javascript code because browser can't understand the their no inbuilt methods to understand.
3] App.js is a document which includes afunction returning a jsx value.
4] Index.js will call the app function so that it return HTML code.
5] Returned HTML code is then rendered to root division of index.html.

NOTE :  noscript = displayes the text if JS engine in browser is disabled.

in react using jsx we can create custom tags not in html. 

why?Attribute 

---> to differencate b/w js and html so that why we use camelcase order. 

---> when we are inserting js in html we use {} in jsx.

COMPONENTS -> a function which return the jsx template.
  
JSX -> jsx is a combination of js + XML.
       jsx allows the programmer to write the HTML inside the JS.
       jsx allows us to create custom tags also.
       jsx is a special value, but node js will not understand this special value, we have babbel(transpiler) which converts to normal js value.

FRAGMENTS -> we know js  function can return only one value at a time. if we need to return multiple tags then we enclose using any scementic or jsx FRAGMENTS <> </>.

            Better to use <> </> to enclose, because it prevents creating extra container.

Formatting -> React is a combination of html and js so we fromat the code using brackets.

            1] HTML {JS}  HTML
            2]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Event handling -> case 1: if function has zero parameter, just pass function reference (name).
                        eg: onClick = {functionName}

                  case 2: if function has some parameters, then use Callback and invoke the function.
                        eg: onClick = {()=>{function(arguments)}} 

  short cut keyboard -- tab
                       shift + tab 
                       alt shift + f (fromat document)    


State management -> 

set method value will be updated and then  component will be re-render.
